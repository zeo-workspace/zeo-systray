# zeo-systray

A desktop tray indicator for **Claude Code** agent sessions. It shows what your
agents are doing — running, waiting on you, finished, or parked on background
work — without you having to keep the window in front of you.

It is an unofficial project, not affiliated with or endorsed by Anthropic.

> Despite the name, this does **not** require the `zeo` editor, or any editor.
> It is fed by Claude Code hooks, so it covers every session: your editor's
> agent panel and the ones you start in a terminal, equally.

## How it works

```
~/.claude/settings.json hook  →  zeo-systray notify   (reads the hook payload on stdin)
                                      ↓ datagram, $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/zeo-systray.sock
                                 zeo-systray daemon   (tray icon + desktop notifications)
```

One binary, two modes. The `notify` mode runs on the critical path of every
agent turn, so it is deliberately trivial: read stdin, send one datagram, exit.
It **always exits 0** — a tray that is not running must never surface as a
failure inside an agent session.

The daemon keeps state in memory only. Nothing is written to disk; the
transcripts are already the record.

## What the icon means

The icon has two layers. The **base** is the identity — it never changes shape,
so you can find the tray at a glance. A small **overlay badge** carries the
status:

| State | Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Needs you | `dialog-question` | a permission request, or Claude asking for input |
| Failed | `dialog-error` | the turn ended with an error |
| Background | `system-run` | the turn finished, but background work is still running |
| Running | *(none)* | the agent is working |
| Idle | *(none)* | nothing in flight |

Running and idle carry no badge on purpose: a marker on every single turn is
noise, and what deserves a glance is the states that are *not* business as usual.

With several sessions open the badge shows the **worst** state, because that is
the one with a person blocked on it. The tooltip breaks down the counts, and
`NeedsAttention` is reserved for the one state where someone is actually stuck —
it is what makes Plasma highlight the item.

Badges are freedesktop theme names, so they follow your theme, light or dark.

### Choosing the base icon

The bundled mark is the default. Two environment variables change it, both read
once at startup:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ZEO_SYSTRAY_ICON` | any icon name in your theme, e.g. `dev.zed.Zed-Nightly` |
| `ZEO_SYSTRAY_ICON_PATH` | extra directory searched for icons — lets the daemon run from a build tree before anything is installed |
| `ZEO_SYSTRAY_OPEN_CMD` | what a menu row runs; `{session}` and `{cwd}` are substituted |

When the bundled icon is in use and none of these is set, the daemon points the
host at `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps` itself. That looks redundant
and is not: a desktop shell reads the icon theme index once at startup, so
installing this package into a running session leaves the shell without the name
and the icon comes up blank until the next login. Naming the directory sidesteps
a cold index. Measured on Plasma 6.

A caveat worth knowing before you switch: an application icon with an opaque
rounded background tends to swallow the overlay badge. Measured on Plasma with
`dev.zed.Zed-Nightly` — the base renders fine, the badge does not show. The
bundled mark is transparent SVG, so the badge lands cleanly on its corner.

## The menu

| Entry | What it does |
|---|---|
| a session row | opens that thread — see below |
| Recent notifications | the last 20 events, each also clickable |
| Silence notifications | stops the popups; the history keeps recording |
| Clear finished | drops sessions that have nothing left running |

Middle-clicking the icon is a shortcut for **Clear finished**.

Notifications carry an **Open thread** button, and a permission request is
raised as *critical* — the desktop will not dismiss it on a timer, because the
agent is stopped until someone answers.

### Opening a thread

Clicking a row runs, by default:

```
zeo zed://agent?session=<id>&cwd=<dir>
```

with the first editor CLI found on `PATH` — `zeo` (Zeo), `zedit` (Zed),
`zedit-bin` (Zed's prebuilt package) — and `xdg-open` only when none is. The
link is spelled `zed://` for both editors on purpose: Zeo registers `zeo://`
with the desktop, so `xdg-open zed://` finds nobody once Zeo replaces Zed, and
Zeo matches agent links only in their `zed://` spelling. Both CLIs accept it.

That deep link reopens the agent thread by its session id. It needs a Zed that
understands `?session=` — the URL handler accepts `?prompt=` upstream, and the
session form is a downstream patch. Without it, the link still opens the agent
panel, just not on that thread.

The thread opens in the window holding its project, whichever virtual desktop
that window is on — not in the window that happened to have focus when the
notification was clicked. Zed finds the project from its own record of the
thread; `cwd` is only consulted for a thread it has no record of yet.

`ZEO_SYSTRAY_OPEN_CMD` replaces the command; `{session}`, `{cwd}` and
`{cwd_query}` — the directory percent-encoded for a URL query — are
substituted. To open the directory instead:

```sh
ZEO_SYSTRAY_OPEN_CMD='xdg-open {cwd}'
```

The command is split on whitespace and executed directly — never through a
shell, because `{cwd}` is a path and a path can contain anything.

### Bringing the window to the front (KDE)

On Wayland an application cannot raise itself: the compositor refuses an
activation request from a process that does not already have focus — that is
focus-stealing prevention doing its job. Zed asks; KWin says no. What *can*
switch virtual desktop and raise the window is KWin itself, and
`contrib/zeo-systray-open-kde.sh` asks it through a throwaway KWin script:

```sh
ZEO_SYSTRAY_OPEN_CMD='/usr/share/zeo-systray/zeo-systray-open-kde.sh {session} {cwd}'
```

It matches the window by the project half of its caption against the name of
the session's working directory and then of each parent — a session running in
a subdirectory still finds its project's window — switches to that window's
desktop, activates it, and only then hands the link over, through the same editor
CLI (`ZEO_SYSTRAY_KDE_LINK_OPENER` names another program). It tries
once more a second later, for a project Zed had to open a window for.
KDE-only by nature, which is why it is a script beside the daemon and not code
inside it.

## Plan usage limits

The tray also watches your Claude plan's usage limits and raises a
notification as each one fills:

| Window | Notified every |
|---|---|
| 5-hour | 5% |
| Weekly | 10% |
| Per-model weekly (Fable, today) | 10% |

The current numbers sit in the tooltip and at the top of the menu, with the
time left until each resets.

No hook carries these numbers, so they come in by two other roads:

| Road | Covers | Windows | Updates |
|---|---|---|---|
| `zeo-systray statusline` as your `statusLine` command | terminal sessions, and the TUI adapter (it runs the real `claude`) | 5-hour, weekly | after every API response |
| the `claude-agent-acp-plus` adapter's shared sample, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/claude-acp-quota-*.json` | Zed agent-panel sessions | 5-hour, weekly, **per-model** | end of every turn, and every 60 s while a session is open |

The per-model buckets travel **only** by the second road — the status line
payload does not carry them. With no Zed session open, Fable is not updated.

Neither road needs this program to read your credentials or open a network
connection, which is why the service unit can keep
`RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX`. Near real time is the honest description:
nothing pushes a usage change the moment it happens, so a step is seen at the
next API response or the next sample.

To wire up the status line road, in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"statusLine": { "type": "command", "command": "zeo-systray statusline" }
```

It prints `5h 45% · 7d 42%`, which is what Claude Code draws. If you already
have a status line script, keep it and feed the tray from inside it with
`… | zeo-systray statusline --quiet`, which forwards and prints nothing.

Rules worth knowing:

- **The first sample after the daemon starts is silent.** It is a window already
  in progress; announcing "40%" at login would be news about the past. A window
  seen to reset is counted from zero.
- **Each step is announced once per window.** The numbers genuinely wobble
  between samples (15% → 18% → 15% has been measured with nothing running), so
  the highest step announced is latched until the window resets.
- A jump across several steps raises one notification, for the highest.
- **Silence notifications** covers these too; the history still records them.

## Background task outcomes

Zeo watches the background tasks its agent threads start — a shell command, a
subagent — and when one ends out of view it sends the tray a **task-outcome
datagram**. It sends one when a task you asked it to watch ends, and for any
task that fails, watched or not. It sends nothing when Zeo has focus and the
task's thread is the one already on screen: you saw it end.

The daemon turns that into a desktop notification:

| | |
|---|---|
| Title | `Task <outcome> — <project>`, e.g. `Task failed — zed-patches` |
| Body | `<thread title> · <duration>`, e.g. `Bump the series · 20s`; a thread with no title yet is named by its task type (`shell`, `subagent`, …) |
| Click | opens that thread, through the same path as a menu row — see [Opening a thread](#opening-a-thread) |

The outcome is one of `completed`, `failed`, `stopped`, `interrupted`. None of
them is *critical*: nobody is blocked on a task that already ended.
**Silence notifications** stops the popup; the event still lands in **Recent
notifications**.

This is the one datagram the hooks do not send — Zeo does, straight to the
socket. Nothing has to be wired up on the tray's side, and a tray that is not
running costs Zeo nothing: the datagram is dropped without blocking.

### The datagram

One JSON object, one datagram, to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/zeo-systray.sock`. This is
`tests/fixtures/task-outcome.json`:

```json
{
  "task_outcome": "failed",
  "session_id": "sess-013",
  "task_id": "task-7",
  "cwd": "/home/user/zed-patches",
  "project": "zed-patches",
  "thread_title": "Bump the series",
  "task_type": "shell",
  "duration_ms": 20500
}
```

`task_outcome` is what tells it apart from the other two datagrams — neither a
hook event nor a usage report has that field — so a sender that adds it can be
read only as a task outcome. `thread_title` may be `null`. Any other field is
ignored.

### Testing it by hand

With the daemon running, send the fixture from the repository root, with either
tool:

```sh
socat -u - UNIX-SENDTO:"$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/zeo-systray.sock" < tests/fixtures/task-outcome.json
```

```sh
python3 -c 'import os, socket, sys; socket.socket(socket.AF_UNIX, socket.SOCK_DGRAM).sendto(sys.stdin.buffer.read(), os.path.join(os.environ["XDG_RUNTIME_DIR"], "zeo-systray.sock"))' < tests/fixtures/task-outcome.json
```

A popup titled `Task failed — zed-patches` should appear, and the daemon logs a
`task outcome` line with the outcome, session, task, project and duration. A
payload it cannot parse is logged as `discarded malformed datagram` and
dropped — that line is the first place to look when nothing shows.

## Install

```sh
cargo build --release
install -Dm755 target/release/zeo-systray ~/.local/bin/zeo-systray
install -Dm644 assets/zeo-systray.svg ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/zeo-systray.svg
install -Dm644 contrib/zeo-systray.service ~/.config/systemd/user/zeo-systray.service
systemctl --user enable --now zeo-systray.service
```

Then add the hooks, and optionally the status line for usage limits. See
`contrib/hooks.example.json` — **append** to the arrays
already in your `~/.claude/settings.json` rather than replacing them, or you
will drop whatever else you run on those events.

To see the icon before installing or wiring anything up, straight from the
build tree:

```sh
ZEO_SYSTRAY_ICON_PATH="$PWD/assets/theme" cargo run -- daemon --demo
```

## Desktop support

It speaks [StatusNotifierItem](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/StatusNotifierItem/)
over D-Bus directly — no GTK, no libappindicator.

| Desktop | Status |
|---|---|
| KDE Plasma | works out of the box; SNI is theirs |
| XFCE, MATE, Cinnamon, Budgie, LXQt | supported |
| Wayland | irrelevant — SNI is D-Bus, not a display protocol |
| **GNOME** | **needs an extension**: [AppIndicator Support](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) or [Status Tray](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/9164/status-tray/) |

GNOME removed built-in tray support, so *every* tray application needs that
extension. There is nothing this program can do about it.

## What crosses the socket, and what does not

A hook payload can carry `last_assistant_message`, tool inputs, a shell task's
full command line and the transcript path — any of which may hold a token or
personal data. **None of that is forwarded.** The datagram carries only:

- the session id and working directory,
- a project label derived from that directory,
- the session title when Claude Code supplies one,
- counters and type labels for background tasks (`shell`, `subagent`, …) —
  never the command itself,
- on `Notification` only, the display text Claude itself wrote, because a
  notification with no text is useless.

A usage datagram carries only each window's name, percentage and reset time.
A task-outcome datagram carries identifiers, the working directory, the project
label, the thread title, a type label and a duration — a task's description,
summary and command line have no field to travel in, so a sender that adds
them anyway has them dropped at parse time.
The status line payload also holds the working directory, the transcript path
and the model; the `statusline` mode reads `rate_limits` and nothing else.

This boundary is enforced by tests (`src/protocol.rs`), not only by review.

The socket lives in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` — per-user, mode 0600, never TCP.

## Known rough edges

- Killing the daemon leaves the socket file behind. Harmless: the next start
  removes a stale socket before binding.
- The history lives in memory, like everything else here: restarting the daemon
  starts it empty.
- Hooks are a Claude Code mechanism, so sessions from other agents (Codex,
  Gemini, an editor's own built-in agent) are not covered.
